## Versions

- **2.0+**: Introduced the plugin system, grouping, sorting, and filtering.
- **3.0+**: Breaking changes introduced:
    -   Removed the redundant viewport component.
    -   Renamed classes to support Bootstrap and other libraries:
        -   `row` -> `rgRow`
        -   `col` -> `rgCol`
        -   `data-cell` -> `rgCell`
        -   `data-header-cell` -> `rgHeaderCell`
    -   Migrated all method names to lowercase to align with modern event naming conventions. For example, `afterEdit` is now `afteredit`. Check the API for details.
    -   Added support for pure ESM modules to enable the use of the grid in all modern frontend tooling like Vite, Parcel, etc. You can now import custom elements without lazy loading. Note that you are responsible for polyfills.


- **4.0+**: Breaking changes introduced. See the [migration guide](https://rv-grid.com/guide/migration). 

-   Redesigned type support:
        - Removed deprecated namespaces:
            - **Before**: `RevoGrid.ColumnRegular`
            - **Now**: `ColumnRegular`;
        - Improved type import:
            - **Before**: `import { RevoGrid } from '@revolist/revogrid/dist/types/interfaces'`
            - **Now**: `import { ColumnRegular } from '@revolist/revogrid'`.
        - Changed viewport type names everywhere. For example, before: `rowDefinitions: [{ type: "row", index: 0, size: 145 }]`, after: `rowDefinitions: [{ type: "rgRow", index: 0, size: 145 }]`.
    -   Updated [event](https://rv-grid.com/guide/api/revoGrid.html#Events) naming convention. Review your [event](https://rv-grid.com/guide/api/revoGrid.html#Events) usage. [Event names](https://rv-grid.com/guide/api/revoGrid.html#Events) are all lowercase now and are aligned with modern event naming conventions. For example, `afterEdit` -> `afteredit`.
